    // this wouldn't be called

    // We now need a pointer to our faceview

    // Remember back to the earliest parts of the course 
    // We just use the good ole control drag from the storyboard into this class
    
    // With this we now have a pointer to this view so we can now changes aspects of it
    // updateUI is called when the system  is wiring up this IBOutlet 
    // this only happen on initialization all of the other times didSet() will be called 
    // when FacialExpression is set, and thereby activating the didSet -> updateUI() method
    // We are updating the UI when our model is hooked up, i.e here and when then model 
    // changes ie view FacialExpression -> didSet -> updateUI()
    //
    // Regarding recognizing gestures 
    // We need to start with adding a Recognizer, so we put it here
    //
    // NOTE: We added the recognizers in code but there is a way to add them va the story board
    // Have both story board and the view contoller on screen 
    // In the object library scroll all the way to the bottom and 
    // you should see recognizers
    // Drag the recognizer to the desired view, you should see the recognizer in the top toolbar 
    // in the story board
    // If you select the Tap Gesture Recognizer in the top toolbar you can view and configure it 
    // in the attributes inspector
    // You can then control drag it into the code as seen below, see toggleEyes
