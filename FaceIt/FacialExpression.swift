// This is the model class of our FaceViewController
// In a sense this is the UI - independent representation of our face
// this class keeps track of the state of all variable components on our face
// Also think of this as the data store of our FaceViewController and via that controller
// we will be chaning our FaceView

// This model has to be interpreted by the controller for the view
// For example the controller has to determine what a Furrowed eye brow 
// means and then how to tell the view do draw that
